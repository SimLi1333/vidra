# Continuous Integration

We use **GitHub Actions** as our CI/CD tool to automate testing, building, and documentation deployment for the **Vidra Operator**. Currently, we maintain three workflows:

- **Deploy Docs**
- **Operator CI**
- **Operator CLI**

## Deploy Docs

This workflow is responsible for deploying the docusaurus documentation to GitHub Pages whenever documentation files are updated. It also generates API documentation for our Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) using `crd-ref-docs` (implemented as `Make` endpoint).

### Trigger

- Any push to the `main` branch that affects documentation files.
- Specifically triggered when:
  - A file in the `docs/` directory is changed.

Check the [`docs.yaml`](../../../.github/workflows/docs.yaml) workflow file for detailed configuration.

---

## Operator CI

This workflow handles linting, testing, building, publishing and releasing the Vidra Operator to the GitHub Container Registry and Github itself.

### Trigger

- Every push to a pull request or push to the `main` branch (protected).
- If any file coresponding to the operator is changed.
- Pushing a version tag (e.g., `v0.0.3`) will trigger the build and release process. Version is also tracked in the `Makefile`.

You can find the workflow definition in [`main.yaml`](../../../.github/workflows/main.yaml).

### Lint and Test

- Uses **golangci-lint** to perform static code analysis and linting on the Vidra Operator codebase.
- Executes all tests for the Vidra Operator using `go test` and Ginkgo-based test suites.
- Tests are run using `envtest` to provide a realistic Kubernetes API server.
- A test coverage report is generated and uploaded to **Codecov**.
- Pull requests where the code coverage drops below **80%** will or the new line of code are not covered by tests will have a warning comment added by the `codecov` GitHub Action.

### Build and Publish the Operator

- Uses the official **Docker GitHub Actions** to build the Vidra Operator image.
- Pushes the image to the **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
- The image is tagged with the current version (e.g., `v0.0.3`).
- helmify is used to generate a Helm chart from the operator manifests, which is also published to the GitHub Container Registry.
- The operator bundle is generated using `Make bundle-build` and published to the GitHub Container Registry.
- The images are signed using **cosign**, allowing users to verify its authenticity and integrity.

---
## Operator CLI
This workflow is responsible for building and testing the Vidra Operator CLI tool, which provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Vidra Operator.

### Trigger
- Every push to a pull request or push to the `main` branch (protected).
- If any file corresponding to the operator CLI is changed.
You can find the workflow definition in [`cli.yaml`](../../../.github/workflows/cli.yaml).

### Lint and Test
- Uses **golangci-lint** to perform static code analysis and linting on the Vidra Operator CLI codebase.
- Executes all tests for the Vidra Operator CLI using `go test` and Ginkgo-based test suites.

### Build and Publish the CLI
- Uses the official **Docker GitHub Actions** to build the Vidra Operator CLI image.
- Pushes the image to the **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.
- The image is tagged with the current version (e.g., `v0.0.3`).
- The CLI is built and packaged as a binary, which is also published to the GitHub Releases.
- The CLI binary is signed using **cosign**, allowing users to verify its authenticity and integrity.

## Code Quality and security Checks

- **Dependabot** is configured to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates of packages used in the operator.
- **CodeQL** is used to perform static code analysis and security checks on the codebase. It scans for vulnerabilities and potential issues in the code, helping maintain a high standard of code quality and security.
