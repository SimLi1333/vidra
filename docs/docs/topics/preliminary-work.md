# Preliminary Work

While Kubernetes operators and controller frameworks like Kubebuilder are well-established, there has been no prior integration between Infrahub and Kubernetes.

Vidra is the first operator to connect Infrahub with Kubernetes.
Potentially existing solutions most certainly had to include another tool in between, like Git, which would not be able to provide the same level of integration and automation as the operator does.

Therefore, Vidra lays entirely new groundwork by combining Infrahub with Kubernetes.
