# Split of Work

## Context and Problem Statement

To efficiently progress with the project, we needed to allocate responsibilities based on each teammate's strengths and interests, while ensuring collaborative decision-making and shared code ownership.

## Considered Options

* **Divide work by technical expertise and interest**  
    Each teammate focuses on areas where they have the most experience or motivation, but all major decisions and code reviews are done together.
* **Divide work by feature or component**  
    Assign specific features or components to each teammate, with less overlap and potentially less shared understanding.
* **Work together on all tasks**  
    Both teammates work on all aspects together, which may slow progress but maximizes shared knowledge.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: Divide work by technical expertise and interest.**  
Simon took responsibility for developing the operator, leveraging his experience with Go and interest in the challenge. Ramon focused on adapting InfraHub to fit our use cases, including generating YAML manifests and creating a frontend. Despite this division, all major decisions were made collaboratively, and we conducted code reviews of each other's work to maintain shared understanding and code quality.

### Consequences

* Good: Efficient use of individual strengths, faster progress, and maintained high code quality through collaboration and reviews.
* Bad: Potential for knowledge silos, mitigated by regular code reviews and shared decision-making.
