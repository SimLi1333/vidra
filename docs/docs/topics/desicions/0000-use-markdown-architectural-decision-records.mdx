# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

# Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made throughout the development of the Vidra project. These decisions often involve trade-offs, alternatives, and rationales that should be clearly documented to help current and future contributors understand the reasoning behind the architecture.

The format and structure of these decision records should be:

- Easy to write and maintain.
- Friendly to developers familiar with Markdown and Git-based workflows.
- Simple enough to not slow down development, but structured enough to be useful in the long term.
- Supported by tooling where possible.

# Considered Options

* **[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) 4.0.0 – Markdown Architectural Decision Records**  
  A lean, structured Markdown format for documenting decisions, designed to be readable, minimal, and Git-friendly.

* **Sustainable Architectural Decisions – The Y-Statements**  
  A highly structured format intended to make decisions measurable, but possibly too heavyweight for our needs.

* **Other templates listed at [https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)**  
  Includes various formats with varying degrees of complexity and structure.

* **Formless – No conventions for file format and structure**  
  Ad-hoc documentation in any form, without a defined standard or naming convention.

# Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "MADR 4.0.0"**, because:

- It promotes making implicit assumptions explicit, helping future contributors understand the design rationale.
- It aligns well with our fast-moving and iterative development style.
- The structure is simple, readable, and easy to review in code reviews or documentation audits.
- It encourages consistency without being overly restrictive.
- The project is actively maintained and has supporting tooling, such as the *ADR Manager* extension for Visual Studio Code.
- Version 4.0.0 was the latest available when we began documenting our ADRs.

### Consequences
* Good, because it provides a clear, structured way to document decisions without being overly complex.
* Bad, because it may require some initial effort to set up and get used to the format.

We believe MADR strikes the right balance between structure and flexibility for Vidra's needs.
