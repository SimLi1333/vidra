# Documenting Vidra with Docusaurus

## Context and Problem Statement

We needed to choose a documentation framework for Vidra. We think consistency of documentation across projects is important for maintainability and user experience.

## Considered Options

* **Docusaurus**  
    A popular documentation framework based on React, widely used in the Infrahub ecosystem. It allows us to maintain a consistent look and feel with other Infrahub tools, and it integrates well with our existing CI/CD pipeline for automated publishing.

* **MkDocs**  
    A simpler, static site generator that is easy to set up and use. It is lightweight and has a straightforward configuration, but it does not provide the same level of customization and integration as Docusaurus.

We also used **crd-ref-docs** to generate API documentation for our Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This is integrated into our CI pipeline which published automatically to GitHub Pages.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Docusaurus"**, because it allows us to blend in with the documentation style of other Infrahub tools, ensuring a unified experience for users and contributors. While MkDocs was considered for its simplicity, consistency integration and style were prioritized.

### Consequences

* Good: Consistent documentation experience across all Infrahub projects, easier maintenance, and streamlined publishing via GitHub Actions.
* Bad: Slightly steeper learning curve compared to MkDocs, but mitigated by looking at existing usage of dokusaurus in infrahub.
