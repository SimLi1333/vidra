A continuous deployment Kubernetes operator for [Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub) 

`Vidra` is a Kubernetes operator designed to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of k8s resources defined in [Infrahub](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub) on Kubernetes clusters. It streamlines continuous deployment workflows, reduces operational overhead, and simplifies the management of complex k8s deployments.

It automates syncing infrastructure artifacts from Infrahub into Kubernetes CRs. And reconciles the synced manifest with the state of the cluster, enabling continuous deployment workflows.
