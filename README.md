A continuous delivery Kubernetes operator for Infrahub

`Vidra` is a Kubernetes operator designed to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of application and resources defined in Infrahub on Kubernetes clusters. It streamlines continuous delivery workflows, reduces operational overhead, and simplifies the management of complex application or virtual machine deployments.

It aims to automate syncing infrastructure artifacts from Infrahub into Kubernetes CRDs. And reconciles them with the state of the cluster, enabling continuous delivery workflows.
